#Note that the sort method does not return a sorted version of the list. In fact, it returns the value None. But the list itself has been modified. This kind of operation that works by having a side effect on the list can be quite confusing.
#In this course, we will generally use an alternative way of sorting, the function sorted rather than the method sort. Because it is a function rather than a method, it is invoked on a list by passing the list as a parameter inside the parentheses, rather than putting the list before the period. More importantly, sorted does not change the original list. Instead, it returns a new list.

print(L3)
print(sorted(L2))
print(L2) # unchanged

print("----")

L2.sort()
print(L2)
print(L2.sort())  #return value is None
