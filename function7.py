#An assignment statement in a function creates a local variable for the variable on the left hand side of the assignment operator. It is called local because this variable only exists inside the function and you cannot use it outside. For example, consider again the square function:
def square(x):
    y = x * x
    return y

z = square(10)
#print(y) #Error. The variable y only exists while the function is being executed â€” we call this its lifetime. When the execution of the function terminates (returns), the local variables are destroyed.

#Formal parameters are also local and act like local variables. For example, the lifetime of x begins when square is called, and its lifetime ends when the function completes its execution.
#So it is not possible for a function to set some local variable to a value, complete its execution, and then when it is called again next time, recover the local variable. Each call of the function creates new local variables, and their lifetimes expire when the function returns to the caller.
#Variable names that are at the top-level, not inside any function definition, are called global.
#It is legal for a function to access a global variable. However, this is considered bad form by nearly all programmers and should be avoided.
def badsquare(x):
    y = x ** power
    return y

power = 2
result = badsquare(10)
print(result)

#Although the badsquare function works, it is silly and poorly written. We have done it here to illustrate an important rule about how variables are looked up in Python. First, Python looks at the variables that are defined as local variables in the function. We call this the local scope. If the variable name is not found in the local scope, then Python looks at the global variables, or global scope. This is exactly the case illustrated in the code above. power is not found locally in badsquare but it does exist globally. The appropriate way to write this function would be to pass power as a parameter.
#There is another variation on this theme of local versus global variables. Assignment statements in the local function cannot change variables defined outside the function.
def powerof(x,p):
	 power = p   # Another dumb mistake
	 y = x ** power
	 return y
power = 3
result = powerof(10,2)
print(result)

#The value of power in the local scope was different than the global scope. That is because in this example power was used on the left hand side of the assignment statement power = p. When a variable name is used on the left hand side of an assignment statement Python creates a local variable. When a local variable has the same name as a global variable we say that the local shadows the global. A shadow means that the global variable cannot be accessed by Python because the local variable will be found first. This is another good reason not to use global variables. As you can see, it makes your code confusing and difficult to understand.
#If you really want to change the value of a global variable inside a function, you can can do it by explicitly declaring the variable to be global, as in the example below. Again, you should not do this in your code. The example is here only to cement your understanding of how python works.
def powerof(x,p):
	global power  # a really...
	power = p     # ...bad idea, but valid code
	y = x ** power
	return y
power = 3
result = powerof(10,2)
print(result)
print(power) #power will be 2 instead of 3
